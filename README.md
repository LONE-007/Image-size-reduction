 Image Compression and Resizing

This project provides a simple and intuitive web interface for compressing and resizing images. Users can select images, specify target file size, and adjust dimensions while maintaining the original aspect ratio. The tool also supports automatic image format selection and dark mode.

 Features
- Image Compression: Reduce image size to a custom or preset value (20 KB, 50 KB, 100 KB, etc.).
- Resizing: Change image dimensions in pixels, millimeters, or centimeters with auto-calculated height to maintain aspect ratio.
- Portrait/Landscape Mode: Adjusts image display based on user input.
- Download Option: Automatic image download in `.jpg` or `.jpeg` format after compression.
- Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized user experience.
- Smooth Scrolling: Automatically scrolls to the preview and download section after image processing.

 How It Works
1. Upload an image using the "Select Image" option.
2. Choose the target file size (or set a custom size).
3. Specify image dimensions, and the height will be auto-calculated to preserve the aspect ratio.
4. Indicate whether the image is in portrait or landscape orientation.
5. Click "Compress Image" to generate the compressed and resized image.
6. Preview and download the image.

 Future Improvements
- Support for additional image formats (e.g., PNG, GIF).
- Enhanced compression algorithms for better quality control.
- Option to crop images before resizing.
